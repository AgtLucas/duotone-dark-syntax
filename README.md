A double-hue syntax theme for Atom.

DuoTone dark uses only 2 hues (purple & gold) and 7 colors in total. It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation, brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.
