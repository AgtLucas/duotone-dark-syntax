# DuoTone dark

DuoTone dark is a syntax theme for Atom.

It only uses 2 hues, purple & gold and tries to:

1. Highlight only the __important__ parts
2. __Tone down__ less important parts. Like punctuation, brackets etc.

This hopefully leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.
